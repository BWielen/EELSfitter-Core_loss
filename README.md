# EELSfitter-Core_loss
An extension of the EELSfitter code for background subtraction of Core-loss EELS 


Use CrSBrWhiteLines.ipynb as an example of how to use the code and the corresponding paper (arxiv link here) for the explanation of the methodology.

Code is made for dm3 and dm4 files, but it is possible to use raw EELS data in the form of a numpy array, for which an energy axis and the EELS data itself is needed.
